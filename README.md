SNAKE GAME


Python Command Line Game 

This Python Tkinter Snake Game is a recreation of the classic arcade-style game implemented using the Tkinter library. It provides a simple yet engaging gameplay experience for users of all skill levels. Players control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body.
Key Features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game features a user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter, allowing players to easily navigate menus and interact with the game.

Snake Movement: Players control the movement of the snake using arrow keys or designated keys. The snake moves continuously in the direction it's facing until directed otherwise by the player.

Food Generation: Food items appear randomly on the game board for the snake to consume. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, increasing the challenge for the player.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats food. Players can compete to achieve high scores and challenge their friends.

Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions between the snake and the walls or its own body. If the snake collides with any of these obstacles, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.

Game Over Screen: When the game ends, a "Game Over" screen appears, displaying the player's final score. Players have the option to restart the game or exit to the main menu.
